New technologies that can help reduce CO2 emissions
===================================================

Direct air capture of CO2
-------------------------
Olivine - Project Vesta

The idea is to speed up the weathering of Olivine - a process which absorbs CO2
from the surrounding medium (air, water)

The company says that making it uses 95% less land and 74% less water, and it
emits about 87% less greenhouse gas than making a ground beef burger patty from
cows.
